# Alaska-Flight-Status
A simple way to get Alaska Airlines flight status web pages

Alaska Airlines creates unique flight status web pages for every flight by appending the flight number and date to the end of the URL like this https://www.alaskaair.com/status/460/2025-06-08

This project simplifies manually editing that URL by prompting for the flight number, and whether you want it for Yesterday, Today (default), or Tomorrow.  It then creates the correct URL and opens that page in your browser so you can see that flights information.
